Both users would reply to the prompt with a picture and would be shown each other\u2019s responses, which they could learn from and connect over.\\n\\n## Low-fidelity Prototype\\n\\nOur Low-fidelity prototype was created using Figma. Below are three user flows for matching with another user, unmatching with another user, and responding to a prompt with a photo or drawing:\\n\\n![Low-fi Use Case 1](../static/img/lowfi-use-case-1.png)\\n![Low-fi Use Case 2](../static/img/lowfi-use-case-2.png)\\n![Low-fi Use Case 3](../static/img/lowfi-use-case-3.png)\\n\\nAll screens of the low-fidelity prototype can be found in our Figma file https://www.figma.com/file/i5OlYD1fbrthNZJaj7cOaY/Lenspa?node-id=0%3A1&t=Vv6UAdPZxCw8lGZ9-1.\\n\\n## Working Prototype\\n\\nOur working prototype is live at https://lenspa.vercel.app! The working prototype lets users sign up, match and unmatch with other users, and respond to daily prompts with images.
