# Lenspa Weekly Report - Week of 03/27/23

With the technical specifications document and mobile mid-fidelity wireframes finalized, we set out to start implementing our final prototype, as well as creating wide-screen mid-fidelity wireframes and finalizing the design stack of the website.

# Goals

- Set up a hosted database so that all team members can use the same test data
- Configure a NodeJS and Express web server
  - Implement user authentication
- Configure a React and NextJS client
  - Implement landing and authentication pages
- Create wide-screen mid-fidelity wireframes

# Tasks

### Ella

- Create a github repo for the project
- Create a NodeJS and Express server and connect it to an AWS MySQL database
- Implement user authentication

### Kayla

- Create the NextJS app
- Create sign in and sign up pages

### Miranda

- Create mid-fidelity wireframes for wide-screen interfaces

### Sarah

- Help Ella set up the database and configure the schema
- Create the landing page

# Challenges

- Multiple members were very busy with other classes, projects, and tests
- One member had a job interview get scheduled in the middle of the week and had to dedicate a lot of resources towards it
- The database schemas decided upon last week had to be adjusted

# Reflection

Due to members being busy, having unforeseen conflicts, and having to temporarily prioritize other things, we did not make as much progress this week as we wanted to. Particularly, while we got the Express server set up and the database connected with the schema properly loaded in to Node, we did not get to creating user authentication on the back-end. The wireframes as well as the front-end tasks got mostly completed, though we did not finalize the color scheme and fonts of the website.
