# Lenspa Weekly Report - Week of 04/03/23

Since we fell somewhat behind last week, we wanted to regroup and catch up to where we wanted to be by the start of the week. Then, since we anticipated our team members having more time this week, we wanted to focus on implementing what we foresaw to be the hardest technical aspects of the project - real time server/client communication and the penpal matching system. We also planned to have an extra meeting to work on the project in the same space for three hours to make sure the front-end and back-end development was on the same page.

# Goals

- Configure user creating and authentication on the back-end
- Decide on framework for real-time communication between client and server
- Implement match requests and matching algorithm
- Experiment with the color-scheme, making the design look less like U of R colors



# Tasks

### Ella

- Create user authentication functions and endpoints on the server with JWT
- Discuss real-time server communication with the rest of team
- Start implementing real-time endpoints for user matching



### Kayla

- Discuss real-time server communication with the rest of team
- Create the requests/conversations page



### Miranda

- Discuss real-time server communication with the rest of team
- Assist Kayla and Sarah on front-end


### Sarah

- Discuss real-time server communication with the rest of team
- Start collecting strings from the front-end for localization



# Challenges

- While setting up websockets and getting real time communication functioning between the server and the client took a lot of time and troubleshooting, having scheduled time to all work on it together in the same place helped us sort it out
- Everything else went pretty smoothly



# Reflection

We were able to make a lot of progress this week and catch up more or less to where we wanted to be at this point. Having almost fully tackled the match requests system got an important technical hurdle and milestone out of the way.
