While the internet has proven to be amazing for connecting to people from all around the world, existing social media platforms do little to challenge cultural and language barriers that keep people stuck in homogeneous social circles. Services rely on written or spoken communication, severely limiting the potential pool of people you can connect with. This problem is important as it contributes to a lack of cultural and world awareness that leads to racism, nationalism, prejudice, and even violence. More needs to be done to usher in an era of global connection and inclusivity.</p><p>Lenspa, is a photo based pen-pal app. Each user will be randomly matched with another user somewhere in the world based on their match preferences. Then, each day, both users would be given the same prompt in their respective languages designed to showcase different aspects of their daily experiences, culture, and realities. Both users would reply to the prompt with a picture and would be shown each other’s responses, which they could learn from and connect over.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="low-fidelity-prototype">Low-fidelity Prototype<a href="#low-fidelity-prototype" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Low-fidelity Prototype" title="Direct link to Low-fidelity Prototype">​</a></h2><p>Our Low-fidelity prototype was created using Figma.

Due to team member schedules and wanting the codebase to be consistent and smoothly interconnected, we decided to have Kayla and Ella take on most of the remaining development responsibilities in exchange for Sarah and Miranda taking a lead on the evaluation and presentation aspects of the project in the coming weeks.</p><h1>Goals</h1><ul><li>Implement random daily prompt assignments</li><li>Implement user messaging</li><li>Implement unmatching and reporting</li><li>Come up with an evaluation plan</li><li>Gather everything that will need to be localized in JSON files / spreadsheets</li></ul><h1>Tasks</h1><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ella">Ella<a href="#ella" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ella" title="Direct link to Ella">​</a></h3><ul><li>Create the socket.io endpoints for loading in conversation and match data, getting user data, sending a new message, and blocking/reporting a match</li><li>Set up prompts to update every 24 hours after a conversation is first created</li><li>Complete the individual evaluation plan assignment</li><li>Add prompt ideas to the prompts spreadsheet</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kayla">Kayla<a href="#kayla" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Kayla" title="Direct link to Kayla">​</a></h3><ul><li>Finish the front-end pages for conversations, user profiles, and picture selection/taking/drawing</li><li>Integrate the back-end API and endpoints into the front-end client

We will use the first few days of next week to iron out those last technical difficulties while also getting translations and our evaluation plan ready to go and should still be on schedule.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Particularly, while we got the Express server set up and the database connected with the schema properly loaded in to Node, we did not get to creating user authentication on the back-end. The wireframes as well as the front-end tasks got mostly completed, though we did not finalize the color scheme and fonts of the website.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog is created to document the creation and development of Lenspa for CSC211.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-lenspa">What is Lenspa?<a href="#what-is-lenspa" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Lenspa?" title="Direct link to What is Lenspa?">​</a></h2><p>When thinking about their community, most people only consider the few circles closest to them: their friends, their family, their coworkers, their neighbors. While the internet has proven to be amazing for connecting to people from all around the world, existing social media platforms do little to challenge cultural and language barriers that keep people stuck in homogeneous social circles. Services rely on written or spoken communication, severely limiting the potential pool of people you can connect with. This problem is important as it contributes to a lack of cultural and world awareness that leads to racism, nationalism, prejudice, and even violence. More needs to be done to usher in an era of global connection and inclusivity.</p><p>Lenspa, is a photo based pen-pal app. Each user will be randomly matched with another user somewhere in the world based on their match preferences. Then, each day, both users would be given the same prompt in their respective languages designed to showcase different aspects of their daily experiences, culture, and realities. Both users would reply to the prompt with a picture and would be shown each other’s responses, which they could learn from and connect over.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="our-documentation">Our documentation<a href="#our-documentation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our documentation" title="Direct link to Our documentation">​</a></h2><p>Our plan is to create a mobile-first web app that will be available on any device with modern internet browsing. We plan to use NodeJS, Express, React, and MySQL. We will most likely use the free AWS plan for hosting.</p><p>We'll be documentating updates each week here.</p>]]></content:encoded>
